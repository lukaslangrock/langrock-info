*This policy is valid for all langrock.info websites and services unless stated otherwise.*  
*Last Updated: 01.03.2025*

Throughout this privacy policy, "personal information" or "personal data" refers to information that may identify you as an individual, such as your name, email address, IP address and other information about you. The mention of third-party sites and services refers to internet services that I do not or only partially have control over.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTICE**  
> If you are looking for the privacy policy for specific applications instead of this website, refer to "[Privacy Policy for Applications]({{< relref "/privacy/applications" >}})".

## Privacy üîí

Some parts of this domain use Cloudflare, which either directly provides the service (like this webpage) or relays data.  
If Cloudflare is used, the connection is terminated at their end, meaning Cloudflare is the point which decrypt the data to provide the service or reach the origin sever (for which another secure connection is used).

Cloudflare generally respects user privacy and is trusted by me with handling both data and security aspects of this domain. Please refer to their respective [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details.

### How do I know if Cloudflare is used?

The following endpoints are **always** routed through Cloudflare:
- `https://langrock.info`
- `https://files.langrock.info`

The following endpoints are **never** routed through Cloudflare:
- `*.home.langrock.info`

*Cloudflare can only really be used on first-level subdomains, meaning a sub-domain which stands directly in front of `.langrock.info` without an additional dot/sub-domain in-between. For example, the domain `example.langrock.info` could be using Cloudflare, but `xyz.example.langrock.info` will never be using Cloudflare in this setup.*

## Security üõ°Ô∏è

Your connection to langrock.info and it's sub-sites is **end-to-end 
encrypted using HTTPS**.  
Additionally, the **HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers are 
sent by most endpoints to ensure your browser will not accept unsecure 
connections.

This encryption guarantees the receiving and sending ends of the connection, so your device and the responding server, that no one in-between can read or modify the data in transit, it does not extend to storage or handling of data on your device or the server.

## Analytics and Tracking üëÄ

There is no kind of tracking or analysis for advertising or data broker 
purposes. The only kind of analysis done is by Cloudflare for the 
purpose of preventing bots from logging into my services or running 
attacks.

## Cookies üç™

The Cookies employed on this domain are not like the ones you always 
here about in the news, they don't harm you :) [Learn more about 
cookies.](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/)

You might have noticed that there is no cookie pop-up or GDPR banner on 
here. This is because the above-mentioned cookies used by my services 
are essential for providing the service and are strictly functional. 
These kinds of essential cookies do not require an annoying banner.

## Data Collection üíæ

Please note that data collection does not mean that you are being tracked across websites, it just refers to the storage and handling of data you or your browser may send to this site.

When using this site or service under this domain, there are a few reasons that data collection can occur:

### Browsing the Website üåê

When you browse this site, or one of it's sub-sites, your IP address and
 other information, that your browser sends along with your requests, 
may be stored in server logs. Logs are used by me to find issues with my
 sites and services, as well as by third-party services I use for this 
website and domain.

### Engaging with services

When you create a user account or otherwise authenticate yourself (eg: 
joining my Minecraft server) your personal information, related to your 
account, and all data associated with it, is stored to provide you with 
the service.  
All services, where you may need to authenticate yourself, are hosted in Germany and operated by me.

You can always contact me to request the deletion of your data.
